        <meta content="The International Socioeconomics Laboratory is a global research institute made up of young adults that strives to find adequate solutions to current socio-economic problems. We use existing records and data to create our comprehensive models and studies to find the root cause of these problems and the best ways to fix them. Our information collection is not limited to what is already in sight; we also collect information and data through surveys and experiments. The goal of Socioeconlabs is clear; assess and address the issues that face our society and create solutions to them to foster a more significant, better community." name="description">

                    <h2>Economics 50</h2>
                    <p class="description">
                        This undergraduate-level Economics 50 course is an introduction to modern applied economics with 45 hours of total instruction throughout six weeks through empirical projects, IRB-approved translative research, faculty lectures, office hour workshops, literature readings, and interactive competitions overseen by the generous intercollegiate academic support and facilitation of volunteer experts.
<br>
                        <br>
                        The topics in this course include equality of opportunity, education, health, environmental economics, and criminal justice to introduce basic statistical methods and data analysis techniques, including regression analysis, causal inference, quasi-experimental methods, and machine learning. Course lectures supplement the development of research projects throughout the fellowship and to give students academic exposure in approaches to education not often offered at many schools.
<br>
                        <br>
                        The course has three main learning objectives: 1) expose students to quantitative analysis on important social and economic issues, 2) teach students how to interpret data using current quantitative methods and simple programming techniques, and 3) demonstrate how practitioners use data to analyze social problems. The course is instructed in a manner in which socioeconomics is taught like laboratory science. Using the practice from the book &quot;In Search of Deeper Learning &quot;, there is emphasis in project-based learning.

                            <p class="description">Matthew Holian is a professor in economics. His research is finding out effective housing and transportation policies in lowering energy consumption and fighting climate change. Over the past decade, much of my research has focused on the climate-change impacts of transportation. My view is that climate change is the defining issue of our time, and I have continued to work in this area, widening my focus to include building codes and wildfire prevention.
