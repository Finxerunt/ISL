    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>Food. Everyone wants it and everyone needs it. Unfortunately, this is not as simple as it may seem. Geographical location, poverty, unstable markets, and various other contributors make it difficult for many people to acquire food, let alone food that is nutritious. With this lack of accessibility to affordable and nutritious food comes a plethora of health conditions, such as diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. Horrible, but preventable nonetheless.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>While this may be news to some, millions of Americans are living this reality. Roughly 23 million people are currently residing in over 6,000 communities known as “food deserts,” which are low-income areas with limited or no access to affordable and nutritious food. According to Bronx resident Josephine Kinlan, these locations are neighborhoods where “the only food markets are small convenience stores or bodegas, or if there is no food service at all, just liquor, drug, and retail stores.”</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>For years, it was believed that food deserts exist strictly due to economic differences. However, recent studies insist otherwise.</p>
    </div>

    <div class = "paragraph">
        <b>Race and Food Insecurity</b>
        <p>Food insecurity is defined by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) as a “household-level economic and social condition of limited or uncertain access to adequate food.”</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>Essentially, this means someone does not have the proper funds to afford to maintain a healthy, life-long diet. Over the years, food insecurity has been becoming more and more common:  increasing from an estimated one in nine Americans being found food insecure in 2018 to one in four households experiencing food insecurity within this year alone.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>Various studies have shown that food insecurity can fall heavier on some communities than others. The USDA has reported that 21.2% of black households and 16.2% of Hispanic households have experienced food insecurity in 2018. This number is drastically different from the 8.1% of white, non-Hispanic households that have experienced food insecurity that same year,  a number which is less than the average percent for all households in the United States.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>A 2014 study conducted by Kelly M. Bower, an assistant professor at John Hopkins University School of Nursing, revealed the poorest neighborhoods struggle the most to access healthy food services. Although this fact was already known, Dr. Bower was shocked to find a correlation between race and the amount of supermarkets in an area. After comparing urban black and urban white neighborhoods of the same economic status, it was discovered “the poor black neighborhoods had the very fewest supermarkets.”</p>
        </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>As a youth who has witnessed the day to day life in food deserts while growing up in the Bronx, Kinlan has cited race to play a major factor in the existence of food desserts. For her, it is more specifically the economic systematic racism of America. “With the majority of food desert communities being low-income, and black and brown, there is obvious evidence that food insecurity perpetuates systemic racism within our communities,” states Kinlan.  “The economic history of black and brown individuals in our society has left more black and brown residents with less property than their white counterparts, and thus more likely to live within lower-income communities, where food deserts are more common.”</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
        <b>Social Distance or Tonight’s Dinner?</b>
        <p>The federal mandated quarantine made leaving the house difficult, even for those who were not as cautious about the virus. Since safety protocols were put in place, many were left wondering when they would be able to buy groceries.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
            <p>Researchers at Northwestern University estimated food insecurity to be more than doubled due to the pandemic. Previously, only 10.5% of American households experienced food insecurity at least once during 2019. This number has jumped to 23%.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
            <p>Grocery stores had to shorten their operating hours. On top of that, people were rushing to buy as much as they could to stock up, in preparation for the worst scenario possible. The six-feet-apart protocol added to this stress, seeing as a limited number of people were allowed in stores at a time. The waiting lines would often wind around the entire block. These are all changes that people residing in areas with access to nutritious food had to make.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
            <p>Food desert residents had to make this adjustment as well, alongside being the only ones dealing with transportation limitations. The United States Department of Agriculture has found urban food deserts to be over a mile away from supermarkets, while rural food deserts tend to be over ten miles away on average. Additionally, the percentage of households without vehicle access in food deserts compared to the percentage of households without vehicle access in other neighborhoods is much greater. With urban food deserts, averaging 24-38 percent higher and rural food deserts, averaging 15 percent higher, many residents rely on public transportation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
            <p>Due to COVID-19, residents had to make the decision between risking their health to buy healthy food for their families or stay COVID-free but risk their health with fatty, processed foods from dollar stores. Given that ultimatum, residents would often choose going to dollar stores.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
            <b>The Intersection of Race, COVID-19, and Food Accessibility</b>
            <p>Rather than being two separate contributors to the severity of the food crisis, COVID-19 managed to compound on top of the relationship between race and food accessibility. New York City, a highly populated, racially diverse urban area, is a testament to this statement.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
            <p>Based on the COVID-19 Household Pulse Survey (conducted from April to July 2020 on New York residents), the New York State Health Foundation (NYSHealth) has provided an analysis shedding light on the rising food scarcity in New York. Compared to the percentages among white New Yorkers, Hispanic and black New Yorkers are three to four times more likely to experience food scarcity, with 17-25% of Hispanic residents and 15-22% of black residents suffering from the phenomenon. The reason behind this gap is most likely that black and Hispanic New Yorkers already experience food instability, seeing as they make up a large number of food desert residents.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
            <p>As of June 2020, New York’s unemployment rates for workers of color have exceeded the national unemployment rates for workers of color.  It is no surprise that communities of color are taking the brunt. A combination of bulk buying, out-of-reach supermarkets, and employees with low-paying jobs being the first ones cut was the undoing of these communities. Since they already struggled to get by prior to the pandemic, they did not have any preparations to deal with COVID-19.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
            <b>Solutions</b>
            <p>Food deserts are a huge problem to tackle, accompanied by other smaller issues. However, this does not mean combating the food crisis is hopeless. For years there has been efforts on the federal, state, and community level to bring nutritious food to these areas. Rather than being discouraged by COVID-19, these efforts are being doubled. A particular organization known for continuing to make food accessibility a reality is the “Catholic Charities Brooklyn and Queens” food pantry network. Consisting of twenty food pantries spread out throughout the two boroughs, the parish-based, volunteer-run organization has done tremendous work before and after COVID-19.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
            <p>Prior to the pandemic, Jennifer Smith, the Food Pantry Resource Supervisor, was responsible for overseeing the food pantries by placing orders, working with the organization's funders, and conducting site visits. Now she spends every day at one of the twenty pantries assisting in the preparation of meals. The pantries are typically volunteer-run, but since they have become so busy, there are not enough volunteers around to handle the workload. Instead, some of the work has to land on paid workers like Smith.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
            <p>“We went from seeing 35-45 people a week to 400-500 people a week,” Smith tells us, referring to one of the food pantries, “Our Ladies of Angels” in Bayridge. In the month of September alone, the organization fed roughly 61,000 New Yorkers over their twenty locations. Smith also mentions how the majority of the people there were “directly affected by COVID. Restaurant workers who lost their jobs, day laborers, taxi drivers, maids, and housekeepers.”</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
            <p>Despite the staggering numbers, Smith and her team took it in stride. The number of volunteers have also increased alongside the number of New Yorkers relying on the pantry to get nutritious and affordable food. In every community where a pantry is located, people often walk up and drop off donations or ask to volunteer.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
            <p>What makes Catholic Charities stand out is not just the positive impact they are having on community involvement but also, their dedication to providing people with healthy and nutritious food. “In our pantry, we really try to whenever we can have fresh produce, have whole grains, have brown rice, low sugar food, low salt food,” asserts Smith. “A lot of people are having to choose whether to pay rent or get food. If they have to buy food, it has to be as cheap as possible, things like ramen noodles, high in salt. All that food is not that great for you but it’s the cheapest option.”</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
            <p>Smith advises concerned citizens who wish to help combat food deserts to contact Catholic Charities’ intake call center for volunteer opportunities, 718-722-6001.  However, if Catholic Charities is not within reach, there are multiple local parishes, community organizations, and city councils that also do pantry work. Some of the bigger organizations she cites are NY Caress and Food Bank for New York City. The problem may seem impossible to overcome, but the work begins on a ground level. No deed is too small!</p>
