    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>It’s a hot summer day and you’re sweating bullets as you trek off to the supermarket. As the automatic doors whoosh open, you let out a sigh of relief and breathe in some fresh cold air from the industrial air conditioners. Walking down the produce aisle, you take in the sights of apples and oranges perfectly sectioned off from each other and bags of leafy greens just waiting to be plucked off the shelf. As you pick up a bag of potatoes for tonight’s dinner, a sudden thought occurs to you. What do potatoes look like on a farm, anyway?</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>As you look around the spotless produce aisle, you realize that you have no idea what any of these vegetables and fruits look like in their natural habitat. What did those strawberries look like before they were packed into neat little plastic cartons? And how are those bananas so perfectly yellow and uniform? You also realize that you don’t even know what regions these foods came from, or how they were transported to the grocery store. There’s a word for it: agricultural illiteracy.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>According to the American Farm Bureau Foundation for Agriculture, “An agriculturally literate person understands how the agricultural industry works – not just where food comes from, but who grows it, agriculture’s effect on the economy, environment, technology, lifestyle and its relationship to livestock.” So, agricultural illiteracy is a deficit of this knowledge. Back in the day, agricultural illiteracy wasn’t a big problem: in the 1840s, farmers made up about 69% of the U.S. labor force. But as the farming industry became increasingly mechanized and replaced laborers with technological innovations, more people moved into cities to find work in factories. As a result, farmers made up only 1.3% of the labor force in 2018. This isn’t necessarily bad because mechanized agriculture is much more efficient at feeding us, but it means that most of us have lost sight of the origins of our food and the sheer amount of resources needed to transport it to our tables. (Replace the old last sentence of this paragraph with this new highlighted sentence.)</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>According to a 2011 survey by the U.S. Farmers & Ranchers Alliance, “Seventy-two percent  of consumers know nothing or very little about farming or ranching” and “86 percent of farmers/ranchers responded that the average consumer has little to no knowledge about modern farming/ranching.” If most consumers are so uninformed about this topic, then how are America’s youth learning about our food?</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>Regarding agricultural illiteracy in American students, past research has linked rising misconceptions about food with a lack of education surrounding the matter. A 2011 study done in urban California asked eighteen children from grades four to six to describe the origins of the ingredients in a cheeseburger. More than half of the participants knew that cheese came from milk and meat patties from “beef animals.”  However, 28% of the children knew that the bun came from a flour/wheat plant and only 22% knew that pickles came from cucumber bushes. 17 out of the 18 students could trace the origins of their food back to a farm or garden, but “descriptions were lacking.” For example, one student said that milk and meat came from farms, but when asked where tomatoes came from, he could only name the store. Perpetuating this misinformation can potentially lead to children developing into misinformed consumers who don’t consider the environmental impacts of their purchases; after all, being agriculturally and environmentally conscious about our decisions is crucial when tackling issues like food waste or climate change.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>According to the USDA, about a third of the food produced in the U.S. is wasted in processing, transportation, and the consumers’ homes, and in 2010, this equated to “approximately 133 billion pounds and $161 billion worth of food.” Some of this waste is inevitable; produce often gets damaged or spoiled during harvesting, sorting, storage, and transportation—-but a lot of it could be prevented. Supermarkets often reject produce if they’re an irregular shape or size because they need to maintain picture-perfect produce aisles for customers, so a lot of produce is just discarded from the start because farmers know they won’t be sold. They also keep their shelves fully stocked at all times to present an image of abundance and attract customers. Have you ever seen how grocery store employees refill produce bins before they’re even empty? The older produce gets pushed to the bottom and eventually spoils while the top of the bin gets refilled over and over. Furthermore, supermarkets often sell imported foods from commercial farms across the country or from overseas because there is a lack of local produce, and this long transportation process not only increases the chance of spoilage but also uses an intense amount of energy and releases carbon into the atmosphere.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>Meanwhile, consumers often buy more than they need, don’t store their food correctly, or misinterpret expiration labels (FYI: “best before” dates ensure quality while “use by” dates ensure safety, which is a key difference when deciding whether to throw out your food!) When this food goes to the landfill and rots there, it releases methane, a potent greenhouse gas that greatly contributes to climate change. Furthermore, wasted food also means wasted land, wasted resources, wasted labor, and wasted money that could have been used for other purposes. We could combat these issues if we educate ourselves and our youth about food insecurity and raise awareness about unsustainable practices in our homes and our supermarkets. In addition, we have a lot of hungry mouths to feed with the population expected to reach nine billion people by 2050. We need a well-educated public to meet this demand so that we can buy sensibly and vote on agricultural policies that create a sustainable food supply. We also need to change our mindset about what the “perfect produce” entails and think about the difference between appearance and quality.(add in this)</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>Another consequence of the disconnect between consumers and farmers is that young people won’t be as incentivised to join the agricultural industry in the future. In 2015, the USDA found that there would be about 57,900 annual job openings in the agricultural industry between 2015 and 2020, but only 35,400 U.S graduates with expertise in that area were available to fill them. Combined with the 2017 Census of Agriculture report that the average age of a farmer was 57.5 years, these findings cast a bleak future for the farming industry. How can we tackle issues in the food supply chain if we can’t attract more workers and thinkers? If we don’t start educating our children about our food sources and encouraging innovation now, climate change and an aging farmer population will continue to make our food supply more and more vulnerable.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>So, how can we educate America’s youth about our food? One solution is to create more school gardens. Trading in a superficial textbook education for a collaborative, hands-on learning environment will encourage students to engage in learning about agriculture. The creation of school gardens can also give them a close-up look at the transformation from seed to plant and a chance to explore the natural world. Studies have even shown that when students engage in school gardens, they have higher grades in science and math and show more willingness to care for living things. School gardens also motivate students to eat healthier because they develop pride in their work and are more appreciative of their food after learning about the amount of work and time needed to grow a single plant.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>A study done in 2017 by Columbia University reported that when schools “provide frequent, high-quality opportunities for hands-on nutrition learning, students eat up to three times more fruits and vegetables at school lunch — regardless of whether or not that food was grown in the garden.” The positive effects of school gardens extend to the home, too. In a 2018 study conducted by Cornell University, researchers found that “children whose schools provided regular school garden lessons had more access to low-fat vegetables and fruit at home than children without that curricula.” The students bring what they learn home and develop healthy eating habits, which is especially important as obesity rates in America rise.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>As a high school student living in the city, I have rarely heard teachers talk about the farming industry or the careers possible in this field. Farmers are just as important as doctors and engineers, for they are the ones who supply our food and keep our nation running. It is more important than ever to have more young minds innovate and change the agricultural industry so that we can continue to have food for all. Agricultural literacy may not seem that important in this fast-paced, internet-filled world, but we should definitely consider going back to our roots.</p>
