    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>On September 18th, Americans found themselves dumbstruck over the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg. At the age of eighty-seven, the influential Supreme Court Justice died from pancreatic cancer while at home in Washington D.C. A pioneer for women’s rights in America and a trailblazer for gender equality, Ginsburg left behind a legacy of empowerment, progressive reform, and political intersectionality. But now, the U.S. population is facing the ramifications of the death of one of the most crucial equilibriums and unifiers of the American government.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>Supreme Court decisions have an immense impact on American society, especially when its constituency is politically unbalanced and is favoring a particular party. While the court’s members are intended to hold unbiased authority, the stark politicalization of the system has skewed the administrative power. In the past, Supreme Court justices have championed their power with various rulings that have reformed American society; both good and bad. The Supreme Court, particularly, has had impressive potency over the American education system.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>Dating back to the late 1890s, the educational implications of Supreme Court power showed its true colors. During the Plessy v. Ferguson ruling in 1896, it was decided that racially segregated schools were legally permissible and ethical, as long as Black and white facilities were “equal.” Nearly half a century later, extreme efforts were made to reverse this blatantly racist and unconstitutional ruling that had exacerbated Black education as well as provoked glaring racial tensions in the United States. From these efforts rose the Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka ruling in 1954, where the Supreme Court finally took decisive and unanimous action in this landmark case to criminalize segregation in schools, noting that it was unconstitutional in both the legal and ethical nature of American democracy.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>From the 1890s, 1950s, and then to now, the Supreme Court still has a colossal legislative power over America’s education system, particularly with high schools. Landmark cases like Plessy v. Ferguson, Brown v. Board of Education, Tinker V. Des Moines, or Engel v. Vitale have illustrated the court’s robust jurisdiction and relevance with American educational institutions. With a new era of Supreme Court Justices, the fate of our public education system is full of contingencies. What is the fate of the diversity of schools? What even is the current state of our education system? To truly comprehend the Supreme Court’s complete legislative dominion when confronting American education, it takes a deep analysis of the branch’s prior rulings and current stance.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>Brown v. The Board of Education will always reign as a momentous turning point. In many ways, it was. In the years prior to the case, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) spearheaded a series of lawsuits challenging segregation laws in public schools. It was no surprise that when Oliver Brown's case in 1951 against the Board of  Topeka, Kansas for denying his daughter, Linda Brown, entrance to Topeka's white only elementary schools fell through, the NAACP were there to aid continuing the fight. Within two years of deliberation and a change in Chief Justices, the Plessy ruling was unanimously overturned.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>On May 17, 1954, African Americans across the country rejoiced at the transformation of decades-long demands to desegregate into definitive legal action. The future black youth would no longer feel the integrated "sense of inferiority" to their white counterparts. At least that was the hope. Akin to past strides in civil rights, the desegregation of schools on the basis of race was a slow process. Two years after the Brown verdict was issued, the first African American student admitted to the University of Alabama was expelled after three days of enrollment to ensure her personal safety against violent riots. President Eisenhower had to deploy federal troops to escort nine African American children to a former all-white high school. A larger percent of white Americans moved out of urban areas - areas in which African Americans took up the majority of the population - to suburban, primarily white areas to avoid integration. Regardless, African Americans were propelled by the progress and began turning this reinvigorated spirit towards a new wave of civil rights, one education focused. Despite the well intended efforts, the movement was unable to prevent the slow creeping economic segregation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>Furthermore, the introduction of technology is a new anomaly for many American households. Although many classrooms had implemented the use of technology via online learning platforms, there are just, or perhaps more schools that rigorously promote and utilize the traditional classroom setting for student learning.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>The beginnings can be traced back to Prince Edward County, Virginia, 1959. After the Brown verdict, local authorities closed all public schools and instead, supported white only, private schools as a way to evade implementing integration policies. For five years, African American residents had their education delayed. The Prince Edward County Free School attempted to help but by then the gap was too large. It wasn’t until 1964 that the county’s public schools were reopened when the Supreme Court “outlawed Virigina’s tuition grants to private education.”</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>The Brown v. Board ruling, while it played a significant role in desegregating schools in the U.S. and particularly Southern states from a legal standpoint, it failed to address the circumventions that have been ingrained into state’s school systems because of redlining, school districts and residential segregation, and income.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>In one of the America’s most liberal states, New York, racial segregation is vastly prominent in public district schools. In the early 1930s, appraisers drew red lines around the maps of New York City to indicate undesirable, poor, rich, hazardous, or good neighborhoods, jotting notes down like, “colored infiltration a definitely adverse influence on neighborhood desirability.” As the government systematically segregated and dichotomized New York communities, students and schools faced the consequent ramifications. Most students in New York City, then and now, “are assigned to attend schools based on where they live, which means the amount of funding those schools receive may drastically impact the quality of educational resources available to a student,” says Next Ed Research. While redlining no longer exists, remnants and racial community boundaries are entrenched into the city’s social network and system.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>Much of school segregation in New York has been a result of reinforced school districts, where a home address automatically places a student in that district school. Because of this, many poor Black and brown communities face the burden of a poor and defunded education. Erica Frankenberg, a professor of education and demography, said that, “our findings show that after district secessions, students are increasingly being sorted into different school districts by race.” While school segregation was ruled unconstitutional in Brown v. Board, we still see blatant circumventions of this legislature prevalent in education institutions to this day.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>Regardless of district schools, students in New York still confront extensive racism. Out of a whopping 895 spots at the Stuyvesant Highschool in New York City, only seven Black students were accepted, making the Black population at Stuyvesant less than 0.01%, a number that is continuing to decrease. Black and brown students struggle with gaining the proper resources needed to study and prepare for state-wide tests like the SHSAT. While efforts have been made to mitigate these injustices and constitutional shortcomings, nothing has proved to be fruitful.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>Although the state of education may seem bleak, especially with the disparities highlighted by the Coronavirus pandemic, integration is possible. The fight against educational segregation has not stopped and instead taken a new face in the modern age. Experts have concluded the reason schools are still segregated today is due to wealthy white citizens’ tendency to monopolize educational resources.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>A possible solution proposed is equal funding. Dissenters often argue that schools in low-income communities receive more state funding than schools in higher-income communities. However, David Mosenkis, a data scientist, has refuted this statement. His research showed “At any given poverty level, districts that have a higher proportion of white students get substantially higher funding than districts that have more minority students.” Race is still a contributor to funding and in fact, compounds upon the wealth gap. Equal funding would allow for schools with a larger black and brown community to implement the same resources in sports, standardized testing, and tutoring that primarily white schools have.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>In addition to data studies being conducted, today’s teens are not standing down. Teens Take Change, a teen advocacy group has made significant strides in bringing attention to the segregation of New York City public schools. Earlier this year, the group organized a conference that allowed students to ask Department of Education (DOE) officials about integration, policies, and education equality. Various topics were discussed that night, but the biggest takeaway was Kenyatte Reid, the DOE’s executive director of the Office of Safety and Youth Development, acknowledging the students’ frustration and declaring “we have to have an expedited approach to integrating schools.”</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>Within these past months, Covid-19 has proven to be merely a bump in the road for Teens Take Change. The group has gotten five more allies in the Senate to join them in their fight, held Q&As to further explain their campaign, and has recently, brought to light new data on racial discrimination in NYC high school admissions via a virtual press conference.  Similar to the Supreme Court’s reign over the education system, the people’s unrelenting demand for equal education will persist. In 1954, the will of the people was enough to sway the court. It’s only a matter of time when history will repeat.</p>
