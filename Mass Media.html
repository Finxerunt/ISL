       <p>Picture a standard Instagram feed: aesthetically pleasing photoshoots, the latest celebrity gossip, a series of recycled Tik Tok trends, and a few GoFundMe posts. Click on one of the donation posts and immediately check the comment section. There are three possible outcomes - overwhelming empathy, overwhelming apathy, or a mix of both. 
        In this digital age of connection, it can seem as if people are more disconnected from each other than ever. Statements such as “stop asking for a handout” and “no one cares” are frequent residents of comment sections and threads that ask for help. 
        Many could argue that trolls and hateful commenters are products of boredom. Some professionals, however, believe that it may go a bit deeper than that. The suspected culprit to this increasingly apathetic society is mass media. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>Social media can be overwhelming at times, especially since online political and social discourse have become more common. It can begin to take a toll on a person’s mental health. 
            Apathetic Idealist, an anonymous asker to the New York Times opinion column, wrote about being in a state of “paralysis” in regards to her activism. Roxane Gay, the responding columnist, recommended cutting back on mass media consumption as a solution. Gay cited it as a contributor to her own apathetic tendencies. She describes her actions, saying, “I’ve stopped watching cable news because the 24-hour news cycle has become an incoherent mess.” 
        Consuming repetitive, sensationalized headlines in large amounts have left these two women emotionally drained. In turn, their lack of energy prevented them from taking action against the social issues that concern them. This concept is called compassion fatigue. 
        According to the Compassion Fatigue Awareness Project, the condition is “a broadly defined concept that can include emotional, physical, and spiritual distress in those providing care to another.” Although originally associated with healthcare workers, a 1996 research study investigated the concept’s relationship with mass media.</p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>The study warned that the pervasiveness and repetition of the media cycle “may lead to a normalization of social problems.” People would be less inclined to inquire about society’s pressing issues. Instead, injustice and suffering will be another one of those headlines in the media that is too difficult to overcome. This mentality is also the byproduct of mass news reporting that showcases the problem with no hints of solution, a common practice in the media. 
            After 48% of participants reported using strategies to avoid consuming media about social issues they felt most passionate about, the study realized a common trend. Consumers get overwhelmed by “bad news” and regain control by switching networks. In doing so, they are limiting the time they could spend learning about combating the issue. If this occurs enough times, then people will start tuning out social issues all together. 
            Although the study is dated, its overarching content still holds relevance. Today’s news cycle is far more repetitive than it was in the late 90s. The recent increase of media ownership by only six corporations is a contributing factor. A viral Youtube clip titled “Sinclair’s script for stations” shows that news repetition has reached a peak. The video depicts nine different local news teams reading the same prepared statement sent out by the company that owns them, the Sinclair Broadcast Group. 
            Not to mention, Americans consume 732 mins of media (digital and traditional) per day, surpassing the worldwide average of 487 mins. This overexposure to media increases the chances of developing feelings of apathy. 
            </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "paragraph">
        <p>While mass media can ruin people’s capability to be empathetic, it can also do the inverse. Mass media, especially social media, does have the capabilities to increase empathy. 
            A common worry about social media and empathy is that social media limits face-to-face communication. Many attribute the ability to see and understand nonverbal cues as a valuable part of empathy. After all, everything a person is enduring cannot always be put into words. Whereas, if one is able to see a person who is struggling rather than read about it or see pictures, they are able to feel for the  person on a deeper level. Social media can reduce this personal element. 
            However, a 2015 research study suggests otherwise. After analyzing over 1,000 results of an anonymous online survey filled out by members of the Net Generation (18-30 years old), it was found that face-to-face communication was not actually reduced by going online.
            Instead, it was found that going online allows individuals to form deeper connections. Many people use the internet to interact with friends and family they already know. If an individual consistently communicates online with someone they know in-person, then there is a greater chance that the two will meet up in-person on a later date. All these chances of them meeting up are also chances for them to practice empathy skills. 
            The article also notes that virtual empathy positively correlates with social support, but to a weaker level of real-world empathy. This may seem like a massive drawback for the positives of virtual empathy, but it is not. 
            Larry D. Rosen, a retired professor of California State University’s Psychology Department, once stated “I don’t think [social media is] a problem with a lack of empathy, but a different style. We have to think of empathy as a continuum. The experience that we hear from kids and young adults is they do feel like they’re being empathetic.” 
            This feeling could arise because social media allows people to show support in different ways. Despite disparaging comments, there have been multiple successful GoFundMe efforts due to the use of social media. For example, Immigrant Families Together, a foundation dedicated to reuniting families separated at the border, has raised over 1.8 million dollars through their current GoFundMe account. This money would not have been raised without social media and its empathy.

    <div class = "paragraph">
        Instead of asserting that the relationship between mass media and empathy is a straightforward concept, we should view it as a balance. Too much media consumption can result in compassion fatigue that gives way to desensitization and apathy. Yet at the same time, being on social media has helped people’s empathy levels. Since they are exposed to different walks of life, they become more tolerant and have an easier time extending empathy to others. 
	A good middle ground would be setting a limit on what type of media you consume and how often. Hopefully through this, the media can continue to be used as a way of exercising human empathy while also avoiding slowly turning into apathy.
