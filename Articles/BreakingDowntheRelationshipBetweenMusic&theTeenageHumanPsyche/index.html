        <p>Music is the art of arranging sounds and crafting harmonious melodies. It has always bridged different
          cultures, a chiasm for shared experiences, and, for many, a haven away from hectic reality. This artistic
          endeavor has provided singers and musicians with broad opportunities to explore vibrant genres and create
          masterpieces. So much so that the music industry generated 21.5 billion in 2019. Not only has music supplied
          visionaries with a growing business, but it has also provided solace for students. Many students have utilized
          music as a coping strategy—to escape the quickened pace of life and perhaps, for a brief moment, indulge in
          harmonious delight. With the onset of the pandemic, students face long periods of isolation, increased stress
          levels, and various mental health issues. Families are burdened with economic distress, failing businesses,
          and the death of their loved ones. In such times of adversity, students—especially high school students—are
          turning to music. One study suggests that people turn to music as a social surrogate. Perhaps with no one to
          turn to, students seek emotional comfort in listening to songs that give form to their personal experiences
          and voice their distress.

        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>We must prioritize the mental health of our students. With long periods without face-to-face socialization,
          students are prone to depression, decreased sense of reality and empathy, reduced ability to cope, and
          increased likelihood of dementia. In most cases, students averted to music which does a lot to alleviate these
          mental health issues. "Music has charms to soothe a savage breast. To soften Rocks, or bend a knotted Oak," as
          described by English poet William Congreve.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Congreve’s words continue to echo across the world as nations continue to deal with the implications of
          COVID-19. There once used to be NYC subways crowded with musicians of all different backgrounds. There was
          once the local street cellist in Columbus circle or the Erhu player offering his calming and foreign music to
          everyday Americans. Instead, there is now a bleak feeling of emptiness across the streets of these once
          vibrant urban centers. Broadway and West End musicals are no longer showcasing every weekend, nor are students
          and teachers despising one another’s company in the final semester recital. The pandemic forced the complete
          shutdown of concerts, bars where artists once gathered and has structurally changed the dynamic of the music
          industry. The industry as a whole has lost upwards of $30 billion worth of revenue as a result of the
          pandemic, and that number is only growing. Although smaller concerts are now opening up, historically large
          concerts with sold-out stadiums are yet to be permitted in most parts of the country.

        <p>Music as we once knew it is different. It is harder to socialize and sing with your friends at karaoke bars
          or come home three hours late from a Travis Scott concert. Where high school students would often be seen
          walking around with their headphones, listening to and blasting Joji, we are stuck behind screens with music
          often being the only escape. So this begs the question, why are high school students or teenagers in general
          so intrinsically addicted to the immersion or idea of music? A TeenVogue article stated that neuroscientists
          discovered that there are dopamine spikes within our brain during climactic moments in songs. This is the same
          chemical that is released during “substance use, exercise, and sexual activities.” At the same time, the music
          that triggers the release of dopamine within our brains is different for each and every person. While one
          person would enjoy rock and punk music, someone else might find joy in listening to classical and pop music.

        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Music itself is able to shape neural pathways and influence the choices and preferences of adolescents later
          on in their lives. It is found to stimulate the prefrontal cortex of one’s brain and creates beneficial
          memories for others. Dr. Rogers, a director of Berklee Music Perception, says that “we know that humans tend
          to bond to music in our teens, this very same music can be our buddy.” In some sense, the lyrics we listen to
          can act as some sort of a trance in which we are stuck and work to tune out the world around us.

        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>This begs the question: can music help the mental health of growing children and adolescents? Researchers
          found that children who listened to more music on average had increased self-esteem and displayed fewer
          symptoms of depression and anxiety. The same children within this study conducted by Northern Ireland Music
          Therapy were found to have increased communication skills and interactive skills compared to their peers. For
          children and teenagers suffering from autism or mental illness, studies have found that music therapy has
          larger effects compared to “placebo” therapy. Even more, there is significant evidence to prove and back up
          that music therapy is effective in memory recall, reducing stress and anxiety before major medical procedures,
          and decreasing hospital stays.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>In truth, music may not always be the best way to help teenagers. However, its proven connection to
          development and healing is one of the many reasons why it has such a great connection to the psyche of
          teenagers. Considering that music therapy has still yet to be fully understood and researched, in the coming
          decades, we will be offered far more transparent information on just how effective it can be. Even still,
          music is something that everyone grows up around and in its rawest form as it truly does bring humanity
          together.
