      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>From brightening our moods to staving off fatigue to even changing our perception of things, music can do so much for humans. There is no doubt that different forms of music have a profound influence on the psyche, so how can one use music as a form of therapy instead of just entertainment? Making music can be almost as beneficial as listening to it and allows people to create tunes with the specific benefits they want to get out of the therapy.

        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Music therapy can also help to relieve pain and reduce stress/anxiety, resulting in physiological changes, which can include: improved respiration, lower blood pressure, improved cardiac output, etc. Since music is usually linked to mood, Psychology Today states, “All forms of music may have therapeutic effects, although music from one's own culture may be most effective. In Chinese medical theory, the five internal organ and meridian systems are believed to have corresponding musical tones, which are used to encourage healing.”  This form of therapy can stimulate creative insights that cannot be unlocked on their own. According to Holly Chartrand, a former vocalist and current music therapist at the Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General Hospital, “The favorite part of my job is seeing how big an impact music can have on someone who isn't feeling well”.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>A significant branch of music therapy is called frequency therapy, which allows for the overall state of human vibrations to rise. These frequencies have the power to cure us, and they have certainly proved to be helpful during meditations. A popular frequency is 852-hertz, and its purpose is to awaken insight of the Third Eye Chakra. It assists us in managing the energy balance in our brow chakra and reaching our “secret awareness,” also known as the supreme domain of the human mind or our intuition. Another popular frequency is 432-hertz, which is claimed to be mathematically aligned with the universe's natural patterns,  bringing together the properties of light, distance, space, matter, gravity, magnetism with nature, the DNA code, and consciousness. Though every hertz frequency has an individual intent, it can ultimately be concluded that they all allow humans to reprogram the subconscious, alter mental diets, reach the higher version of themselves, and communicate with the universe.
            As opposed to frequencies, which focus on our energy levels, subliminals are audio messages set on a higher frequency and at an increased speed, focusing on our subconscious mind. In the process of listening to a subliminal, the conscious mind cannot recognize the message, but the subconscious mind records every little word and sends the messages to the brain; studies even show more achievements of desires when listening to subliminals whilst sleeping instead of being awake. During this time, the mind is oblivious to external disturbances without cognizant control. The most secure approach to use any subliminal audio is during meditation because when someone meditates, their mindfulness continuously arrives at their subconscious mind, which is difficult to do during consciousness.

      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>What are affirmations? Well, even the simplest, most regular thoughts that pop into our brain are affirmations; we affirm things into our lives without knowing it. Affirmations are used in subliminals redundantly so the subconscious can comprehend the message trying to be conveyed. For instance, if a person wanted to prevent fear, they would say:   

        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>“I have the fearlessness to match my fear. I trust my abundant creativity. I am more and more aware of how I hold fear in my body. I trust the strength that opens and blooms in me when I have to face something. I stop keeping fear in my body.  I open my body to joy and serenity.” 

        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Although individual affirmations can all be different, only one affirmation, for example, “I am more and more aware of how I hold fear in my body,” can be repeated several times. Music is layered on top of the affirmations to calm the unconscious mind, thus reprogramming the unconscious mind. If someone added uplifting or idyllic music to their affirmations, it could rapidly help them manifest personal contacts or relationships. As long as the person affirming these thoughts truly does believe them, there is no doubt that they will not achieve whatever they desire. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Sometimes, when we listen to songs with repeated choruses or words, we tend to remember those verses more. In the same way, repeated affirmations in frequency therapies and subliminal audios are more likely to pinpoint desires. We have the power to attract anything we would like into our lives. Undoubtedly, it is engrossing how something as simple as music can enable the accomplishment of our goals.
