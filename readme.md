# International Socioeconomics Laboratory 

Official Code for the Laboratory

The International Socioeconomics Laboratory™ (ISL) is a global research institute made up of young adults that strive to find the most adequate solutions to current socio-economic problems

We make use of existing records and data to create our own comprehensive models and studies to find plausible routes to the root cause of these problems and see what can be done about them or what knowledge can be acquired. However, our information collection is not limited to what is already in sight; though it may be more difficult given the unprecedented times, we also look to collect information and data through surveys and soon, experiments as well. The goal of the ISL is clear; assess and address the issues that face our society and create solutions to them, in order to foster a greater, better society.

The work done in the ISL serves as the foundation for the work done by its sister institute, Finxerunt. We plan on having our research be used by Finxerunt to create policies that will address the shortcomings that stem from society and its current state. Our research will also be used to serve as the basis for ISL’s and Finxerunt’s campaigns, podcasts, and films; while the work Finxerunt does is from a political standpoint, the work of the International Socioeconomics Laboratory™ will adhere more towards social change. Both institutions share a common goal: bringing about positive change in the world.
